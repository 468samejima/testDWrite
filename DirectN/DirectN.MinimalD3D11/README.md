# DirectN
 # .NET 6 - DirectD311 minimal sample.
 This sample has been ported from here: https://gist.github.com/d7samurai/261c69490cce0620d0bfc93003cd1052 which features a minimal DirectD311 "uncluttered direct3d 11 setup and rendering primer for newcomers to the api" sample.
 
 It's dependent on DirectN, .NET 6 + Windows Forms and ... that's it. Here is the output (believe me, it rotates):

 Note: the code still works with .NET Core 3.1 to 5, it's just a project configuration matter.
